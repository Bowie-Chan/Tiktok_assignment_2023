**Descriptionï¼š**

This is a back-end job for the TikTok Tech Immersion 2023 Program. The theme is a backend instant messaging system that requires Golang as the development language. Tools such as Kitex, Redis and Docker are also used in the development process.

First, this system contains two services: one on an HTTP server and the other on an RPC server, which requires the HTTP API. second, this system can store information data, and the recipient can access the data anytime and anywhere. The Redis database is used in this project. Then, this system can deliver messages to the intended recipients by PULL mode in a timely and consistent manner. Finally, the system can handle a significant number of users and messages that pass the test.
